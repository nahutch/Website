      <p class="lead">Welcome to my webpage!</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my webpage. I am currently a Salesforce Analyst at Varian Medical Systems.  I graduated from Santa Clara University in June 2019 with a Masters of Science in Engineering Management and Leadership.  I also received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science(emphasis in Algorithms & Complexity) from Santa Clara in 2018.

      <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p class="lead">Work Interests:</p>
          <p>I want to use my analytical background to propel me into a Project Manager or Analyst position.  During my time as a Salesforce Analyst, I have been able to learn an entirely new system and excel at my role within one year working with a new technology.  My strength lie in my drive, work eithic, and passion to always want to learn more.</p>
        <p class="lead">Outside of work intrests:</p>
          <p>When I am not working I love to ski, surf, and travel the world! All of the photos seen on this website are the photos I have collected over my travels. I have been extremely lucky to be able to travel as much as I have in my life.  Seeing different cultures and people has given me a better perspective about what I want to accomplish in my life. 
          <br/>
          <br/> Outside of travel, I enjoy sports, movies, and music. I also love to learn! I always find myself getting enthralled in new content.  Through my career, I have always been working on outside passion work to keep my skills sharp!
